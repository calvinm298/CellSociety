Recitation 2/1/18
===================

Names: Aditya Sridhar and Collin Brown

### Part 1

1. Implementation decisions that design is encapsulating for other areas of the program include hiding cell interactions from the user interface (made by both teams). My team also implements a layered structure among the game, cell, and object classes.
2. Inheritance exists between a superclass for cells and its respective game-specific subclasses (same for both groups). My team also includes inheritance relationships for game-specific objects and simulations as well.
3. Everything is closed with the exception of graphics (by other team). We have more open components particularly when taking advantage of polymorphism between game and cell and cell and object classses.
4. Most of the exceptions will be handled in XML parsing, probably through try-catches as opposed to throws (both teams).
5. We think our design is good.


### Part 2
1. I will be coding in many areas of the project, including GUI and back-end. Overall, both teams have area-specific designs, including XML parsing, GUI, grid implementation, etc.
